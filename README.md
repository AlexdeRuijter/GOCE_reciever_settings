# GOCE_reciever_tradeoff
This file includes all code research group AB3 of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at TUDelft used to get the results on the 
optimal settings for the GOCE GPS reciever.

These programs use the raw GPS data from the GOCE satellite from the 2nd of September 2013 till the 30th of September 2013.
It uses the Orbit Data, and for both the nominal as the redundant reciever, it uses the RINEX files and the noise residuals.
These files can all be found on the website of ESA:
https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/goce

Beware, prepare a bit of space to unpack, the final size of the files equals around 15 GB.

Anyway, short samples on the data are included in the github, to test the code. These can be replaced with their respective
files if downloaded for the program to run.
